It does this by applying the chain rule to recursively compute gradients for each layer. \n\nIn other words, during backpropagation, the output error is distributed back into the network to update the weights. This means that the error from the final output layer is used to adjust the weights in the previous layers, but it's not accurate to say that each layer is the gradient descent of the cost function of the previous layer. Rather, each layer's weights are adjusted based on the proportion of the error they contributed to in the forward pass. \n\nGradient descent is the optimization algorithm that uses these gradients to update the weights in the network with the goal of minimizing the loss function."

            "content": "Yes, it would be fair to say that. The error calculated at the final layer of a neural network during backpropagation is propagated back through the network and used to update the weights at each layer, including a layer that is 10 layers removed from the output. This happens even though the layer 10 layers removed does not have a direct connection to the final layer. This is because the backpropagation algorithm applies the chain rule to compute gradients for each layer, recursively propagating the error backwards from the output layer to the input layer. This process allows for the adjustment of weights in the network based on the proportion of the error they contributed to in the forward pass, even for layers far removed from the output."
